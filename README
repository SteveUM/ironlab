Building:
You should be able to simply open IronLab.sln and build the solution: all dependencies are included as dlls. This will build into IronLab\dist directory. The dist directory will contain everything needed to exeucte the IronLabApp, including all libraries, numpy/scipy extensions, etc. 

Prerequisites:
IronLab uses .NET 4.0. It may be necessary to update DirectX by downloading and running the DirectX Redistributable. This is because IronLab uses the managed wrapper to DirectX, SlimDX, which may demand an updated DirectX. 

Getting started with NumPy/SciPy:
Build IronLabApp. Execute from the 'dist' directory. Upon the first import of 'ironplot' IronLabApp will attempt to install numpy/scipy in the current directory. You will need to restart the app.

Try:
import ironplot as ip
import numpy as np
ip.plot(np.sin(np.arange(0, 10, 0.1)))
then Examples\NumpyPlot content

ILNumerics support is now deprecated.
